      "Chs": "由翼族学者K'arn_Hollowbeak编写。\n一些极其富有的翼族通常于大量的财富一同下葬于墓穴之中。我一直以为这是相当奇怪的做法，但是我发现许多种族也是采取同样的方式。身为历史学家，把独特的文物封于墓穴之中是最坏的处理方法，不过我还是记录下了死者向往来世能继续享受所葬财富这种异想天开的想法。",
      "Eng": "by K'arn Hollowbeak, Avian scholar\nIt is common for some of the richest Avians to be buried with their worldly possessions. I have always found this a strange practise, but it transpires that many other species do the same. As a historian, it seems a shame to me to seal away sometimes-unique items, but I do also see the romanticism in being able to take your treasured things into the afterlife."
