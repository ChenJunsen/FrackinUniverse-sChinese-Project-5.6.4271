      "Chs": "当最后一辆彩车驶过街道时，整个人群都倒抽了一口冷气，其中一名士兵从看台上跳下来，朝骇翼冲去。最让人吃惊的是那些铁匠，他们很清楚自己的“士兵”只不过是装饰性的盔甲。然而，骇翼却只认为这只是表演的一部分。",
      "Eng": "As the last float made its way down the street, the entire crowd gasped as one of the soldiers leaped from the stand, and charged towards Dreadwing. Most surprised of all were the blacksmiths, who knew full well that their 'soldiers' were little more than decorative suits of armour. Dreadwing, however, thought it was all part of the show."

      "Eng": "The army paraded past on floats, towed by a number of Glitch workers and a Floran who'd decided to join in unannounced. Dreadwing sat atop his iron throne, brought outside into the city, and applauded each and every unit. 'They stand very still,' he remarked, to which his aides replied 'yes, they are very disciplined.'"
