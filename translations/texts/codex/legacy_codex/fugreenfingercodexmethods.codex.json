      "Eng": "Atheist Avians who require punishment are dipped in a vat of tar-like liquid, which solidifies over their feathers, turning their plumage into what is essentially stone. Seeing as the Avians cannot fly, it's a largely symbolic gesture, but one which serves to shame the subject."

      "Eng": "Many are simply sent from the villages, she told me, occasionally even hounded off-planet if their heresy is grand enough. Others, however, are subjected to a process which even to myself sounds barbaric. She stressed, repeatedly, that this behaviour was no longer endorsed by the Clipped Council."

      "Eng": "One day I was fortunate enough to meet with a member of the Avian Clipped Council, a group of flightless Avians who serve their ruler, Kluex. We shared talk, and stories, and eventually a bottle of particularly potent meatjuice. This loosened the Avian's tongue even more, and I was able to ask her about the Grounded, and how her people deal with those who defy their god."
