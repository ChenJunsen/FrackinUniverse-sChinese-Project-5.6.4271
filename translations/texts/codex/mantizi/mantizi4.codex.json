      "Eng": "...long held as the finest wine in the known galaxy, Mantizian vineyards are viewed with utmost respect by virtually all respected wine connosieurs. Few are those among the elite who are not familiar with the narcotic qualities of these wines. Highly sought, their value on the black market is insultingly astronomical."

      "Chs": "然而，对于甲虫人自己来说，这种葡萄酒非常美味。它们对所使用的葡萄中常见的毒素具有天然免疫力，不会产生任何不良影响。 与此同时，众所周知，翼族人特别容易受骗。大多数甲虫人在任何特定的时间都会囤积一些瓶子(如果他们可以从他们家族的储藏室里拿到这些瓶子的话) ，但是他们不愿意与这些瓶子分开。在一些更加无法无天的地区，甲虫族被海盗俘虏，并受到海盗的鼓舞，捐出了他们的货物。",
      "Eng": "For the Mantizi themselves, however, the wine is simply delicious. Their natural immunity to the toxin common in the grapes they use gives them no ill effects. Meanwhile, Avians are well-known to be especially succeptible. Most Mantizi hoard a few bottles at any given time (if they have access to stores of them in their family holdings) but are loathe to part with them. In some of the more lawless sectors, Mantizi are captured and 'inspired' by pirates into 'donating' their supply."
