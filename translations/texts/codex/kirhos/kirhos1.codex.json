      "Chs": "几百年前(或者几千年前... ... 关于这一点的记录并不清楚) ，鼠族人已经达到了科学技术成就的绝对顶峰。 不幸的是，大约在同一时间，他们耗尽了他们家乡所有需要利用他们知识的资源。随之而来的是一系列残酷的战争，摧毁了他们的基础设施，导致他们逃往星际。",
      "Eng": "Some hundreds (or thousands...the records are unclear on this point) of years ago, the Kirhos had advanced to the absolute pinnacle of scientific and technological achievement.  Unfortunately, around the same time, they exhausted all resources on their homeworld required to utilize their knowledge. What followed was a series of brutal wars that devastated their infrastructure and led to them fleeing for the stars."

      "Chs": "他们失去了自己的家园和资源，这意味着他们永远失去了超稀有元素铥唯一已知的所在地。稀土元素是他们所有计算机技术的核心，没有稀土元素，他们就无法保持先前的发展水平。直到一个世纪，也许更长的时间，艾扎克·网状附近的小行星带才找到一种可行的替代物。",
      "Eng": "The loss of their homeworld and its resources meant that the only known location of the super-rare element Thulium was forever lost. Thulium formed the core of all of their computer technology and without it they were unable to maintain their previous level of advancement. It was a century, perhaps longer, before a viable replacement was located deep in the asteroid belts near Azakon Reticuli."
