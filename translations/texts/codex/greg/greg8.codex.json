      "Chs": "格雷格从今天开始有点不对劲。我不能完全说清楚。他的说话方式有问题。问题很小，但就是有问题。我会盯着他的。与此同时，我已经设法分离出这个奇怪的粒子，并在实验对象C7中与其混合。两小时前我给她注射了抗体，现在我等着看会发生些什么。",
      "Eng": "Greg started acting a bit off today. I can't quite put my finger on it. Something is up with his speech patterns. It's slight, but there. I'll keep an eye on him. In the meantime I have managed to isolate the strange particle and neutralize it in subject C7. Two hours ago I administered antibodies into her, and now I wait to see what happens."
