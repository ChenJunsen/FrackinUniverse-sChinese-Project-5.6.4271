      "Chs": "我让格雷格承认: 他把那种奇怪的液体放进了他的混合物里。根据他的说法，测试表明它对生物样本的影响是惊人的，如果这意味着我们种族的安全，那么值得一试。尽管我保证他没有任何行政上的麻烦，但他似乎有点过于保守了。",
      "Eng": "I got Greg to admit it: He put that weird fluid in his mix. According to him, testing showed that the effect it has on biological samples is astounding and was worth a test if it meant the safety of our species. He seems a bit overly defensive , despite my assurances that he was not in any form of administrative trouble."
