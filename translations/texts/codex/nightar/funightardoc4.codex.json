Truly a wonderful find for a historian or someone looking to learn swordplay in the style of the Nightar. There are entire chapters devoted to proper cleaning of blades, how to remove rust and improve the blade by a process called Shadow-Tempering, and proper resolutions to common problems in their society such as stolen blades and intentional damaging of heirloom weapons."
