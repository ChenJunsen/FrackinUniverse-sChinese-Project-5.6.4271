We do know that their language consists of patterns of weak ultraviolet radiation rather than sound. The clicks and squawks they produce seem to have little effect on what they are saying, and are only there for emphasis. One thing we learned very quickly is a vulgar expression in their language, which was said to us repeatedly by an annoyed individual whom we were studying."
